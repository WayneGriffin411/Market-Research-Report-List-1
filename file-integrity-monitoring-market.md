<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The File Integrity Monitoring Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Agent-based</li><li>Agent-less</li></ul></p>
<p><p>File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) markets comprise two main types: agent-based and agent-less solutions. Agent-based FIM involves deploying software agents on endpoints to monitor file changes in real-time, providing detailed insights and control over file integrity. This approach offers high accuracy but may increase resource consumption. In contrast, agent-less FIM operates without additional software on endpoints, using network protocols to track file changes, making it easier to manage but possibly less comprehensive in monitoring capabilities.</p></p>
