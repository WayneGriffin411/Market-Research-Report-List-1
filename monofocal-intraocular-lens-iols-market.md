<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Monofocal Intraocular Lens IOLs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Not Pre-loaded IOLs</li><li>Pre-loaded IOLs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Monofocal Intraocular Lens (IOL) market can be categorized into two main types: pre-loaded IOLs and not pre-loaded IOLs. Not pre-loaded IOLs are manually inserted into the eye during cataract surgery, requiring surgeons to handle the lens directly. In contrast, pre-loaded IOLs come pre-packaged in a delivery system, facilitating easier and more efficient implantation. This differentiation enhances surgical speed and reduces the risk of contamination, making pre-loaded IOLs increasingly popular among ophthalmic surgeons and patients alike.</p></p>
